## Introduction 
[Facebook Polygames](https://github.com/facebookarchive/Polygames) is an open source application with multiple trained models for popular board games including Othello, Connect6, and many more. The only available way to play against these models is through commands in a black and white CLI. Therefore, this project was developed to provide players with a more elegant way of playing through colorful and intuitive GUIs developed in Python.

Within the repository, you will find six main Python files for the six games below.
